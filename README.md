# Exploring the Correlation Between COVID-19 Total Deaths and Median Age

## Introduction

In this project, I aim to investigate the relationship between the total deaths caused by COVID-19 and the median age of populations across different countries.

## Objective

My primary objective is to analyze the correlation between two key variables:

- **Total Deaths:** The cumulative number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 in various countries.
- **Median Age:** The median age of the population in each country.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive data exploration and documentation.

## Conclusion

With a correlation coefficient of 0.23, there appears to be a weak positive correlation between the total deaths caused by COVID-19 and the median age of the affected populations.
